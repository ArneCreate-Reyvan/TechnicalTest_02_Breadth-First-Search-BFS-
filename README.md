## Second Test: Graph Search - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### Task Description
The second test requires the implementation of the `breadthFirstSearch()` function, which takes a graph represented as an adjacency list and performs a BFS traversal starting from a given node.

### Problem Statement
- **Input**: 
  - A graph, `G`, represented as an adjacency list, where each key is a node, and the value is an array of its neighboring nodes.
  - A start node, `s`, which is the node from where the BFS traversal begins.
  
- **Output**: A list of nodes visited during the BFS traversal in the order they are visited.

### Solution
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used for traversing or searching graph data structures. It explores all the nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS uses a **queue** to explore nodes layer by layer, ensuring that all nodes at one level are explored before proceeding to the next level
